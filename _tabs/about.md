title: About

### **An Introduction**

It's nice to meet you! My name is Rhea, and I'm a junior at Harvard studying Applied Math, Economics, and Computer Science, along with a variety of other cool subjects. I love thinking deeply and solving problems with creative people, where we can leverage technology for good. In particular, I'm interested in tech entrepreneurship and investing. In any situation, I strive to learn constantly, embody empathy, and remain focused in the face of adversity. Beyond my quantitative interests, I am passionate about design (graphic, product, and urban), education, sustainability, and creative writing.
