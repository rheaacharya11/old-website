### **An Introduction**

It's nice to meet you! My name is Rhea, and I'm a junior at Harvard, learning about Applied Math, Economics, and Computer Science along with a variety of other cool subjects. I love thinking deeply and solving problems with creative people, where we can leverage technology for good. In particular, I'm interested in tech entrepreneurship and investing. In any situation, I strive to learn constantly, embody empathy, and remain focused in the face of adversity. Beyond my quantitative interests, I am passionate about design (graphic, product, and urban), education, sustainability, and creative writing. 

### **My Experiences**
My personal philosophy is that a genuine passion and a willingness to learn are all that you need to start to make a positive impact within a space. As such, I've tried my best to participate in a wide range of professional and extracurricular endeavors in college, broadening my horizons and allowing me to meet a lot of interesting people along the way. 

In the past, I've been...

* A Sustainable Growth Equity Intern at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, with a focus on applications of AI in Climate Tech
* A Quantitative Trading Intern at Virtu Financial
* A Teaching Fellow for Harvard's COMPSCI 51 (Programming II) and STAT 110 (Probability) courses
* An Investment Management & Project Management Intern at Bedel Financial
* An analyst and project lead supporting VC firms, like Sequoia and Long Journey Ventures, with Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners
* A consultant for Fortune 500 companies in retail and sustainability
* An algorithms developer for Datamatch, a semi-serious matchmaking platform serving 50,000+ college students a year


### **In My Free Time**
When not working, you can find me...

* Making art, whether through graphic design, painting, sketching, or photography
* Reading books, and reviewing them on my Goodreads
* Writing short stories, both fiction and non-fiction
* Spending time in nature, whether through sunset walks, runs, or Blue-biking around Cambridge
* Facetiming my dog Maui, and daydreaming of our reunion
* Drinking hot chocolate (and increasingly Earl Grey or green tea) all 12 months of the year
