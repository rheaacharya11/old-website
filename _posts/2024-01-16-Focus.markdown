May this post serve as a reminder to myself to be more intentional this semester. 

Life is funny in that we are constantly navigating this balance between focusing and exploring. At times, I feel frustrated with myself for not putting my head down and going all in on one topic or one idea. However, many times that I do reach those levels of focus, I fret about whether the commitment, and likely accompanying sacrifice, was ultimately worth it. I think this is true regardless of the level of passion you feel towards the project. 


So here are some concrete steps I plan on taking to ground myself more this year. I might add to this as I think of new ideas:
* Morning routine: To-do list, check email, sunscreen
* Night routine: Skincare, journaling for 10 minutes, reading
* Technology: Keep Instagram deleted from phone (and be stricter about not using browser Instagram on phone or computer!), Keep a time limit on Twitter
* Be more intentional about time-blocking and setting limits for tasks. This will not only create a sense of urgency but will also limit the amount of interruptions (in the form of unnecessary thoughts) that hinder my ability to make progress.
* Talk to at least one new person per week in a research/industry/career context and one new person a week in a social context. Journal about this encounters.
* Don't think about other people as much. I think I generally have high levels of empathy, but I find that too many people live in my head rent-free for little reason. By focusing more on ideas and creation and myself, I hope to spend less time stressing over likely-insignificant social encounters and less time comparing myself to others or projecting their goals or values onto myself. Hopefully, this will push me more towards a life grounded in my desires and intentions, leading me with more down time to engage meaningfully with those I adore.
* Pursue passion projects.
* Do more art (whether that is writing or drawing or painting)
* Make a more soothing Spotify playlist, to listen to when working, so as not to let it overrule my productivity.
* Drink waterrrr <3
