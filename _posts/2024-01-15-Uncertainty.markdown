At times, I can be a terrible decision-maker. Not because I can't reason through the cost-benefits of various paths, but rather because I reason through them so thoroughly that I often reach a state of decision paralysis. I'll lie on my bed for hours on end, running through various consequences of each step given each action taken now, trying to emulate my econ and AI classes and treat life as a sequential game, where each action has a well-defined expected value. And yet even once I've gone through the long list of possible futures and arrived at some best course of action, I find it hard to go through with it. Why is this? Do I fear the act of choosing, or is it something else?

But what I've found is this frazzled state is not born out of a fear of commitment, but rather a fear of uncertainty. 

So often we think back to our childhoods, where all we had to worry about was having someone to play with at recess or making it to state in our debate tournament or getting a babysitting job. We yearn for our states of "blissful ignorance."

Yes, of course, now that we're older, we have bills to pay for and close relationships to build and parents to take care of, but I don't think it is these tasks that we wish we were blissfully ignorant of. After all, we always knew that one day we would need our own money and potentially our own families. Instead, I believe we yearn for a time when we weren't as well-versed with uncertainty. We yearn for the stability of a twelve-grade education system, where everything is lined up sequentially and where no decision will lead you far from this defined path. At times, there is monotonity in our early paths, but especially with the number of subjects we're taught, our curiosities and attention spans are satisfied, making the overwhelming feeling that of comfort in its stability.

As we become college students and later adults, our paths start to fork and the choices that we are presented with have fuzzier consequences. No longer is it a choice between acting in the school play or playing on the basketball team — instead, it might be a choice between choosing to study film for supposedly passion or computer science for supposedly money. I add "supposedly" because no longer is there a clear-cut outcome associated with decisions but rather an assumption made by the observations of other lives. In reality, if you study film, you might produce an Oscar-winning show and make your millions that way, whereas the CS job market might die out by the time you graduate. Here we see that the time horizon for our decisions lengthens — no longer are we looking at the immediate next steps, but we are making choices for our own selves not as they are right now but instead far in the future. The world that we live in then might be quite different, as we can already imagine now with the rapid expansion of Generative AI, but we must make decisions amid this uncertainty and hope our calculations pay off.

So, amidst this inevitable uncertainty, how do we cope? This brings us to the importance of remaining grounded, a concept which can be approached in many ways. Many find this grounding through religion, while others turn to the important people in their life, meditative activities like walking or cycling (or of course meditation), or creative hobbies like music or art.

At its core, these activities help us feel connected with one another or the world around us and remain consistently present, following us down whichever diverging path life takes us on. For the most part, in modern life, we can keep praying, or playing music, or sketching, or talking to our mom on the phone each day/week/month, no matter where we are in the world. These activities, when repeated often and with intention, bring stability to our life to counterbalance the uncertainty of tomorrow.

For me, writing stories or painting helps me remain grounded. I also like building my routines around talking to my brother or mother or roommates, using our conversations to remind myself of stable relationships in uncertain times. Lastly, spending time in nature and soaking each sunrise, sunset, and other forms of sky reminds me of how to find the beauty in those elements of our world that remain predictable.

Let's embrace uncertainty together and live grounded in this moment. Tomorrow will come once it turns into today. It will all be okay!
